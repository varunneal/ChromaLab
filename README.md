**Install via:**

```
pip install git+https://github.com/VarunNSrivastava/ChromaLab
```
**Basics**

This library is based around the `Spectra` object. 
`Spectra` are easy to plot, convert to RGB, XYZ, and combine in various ways.

To initialize a `Spectra`, pass in numpy arrays corresponding to wavelengths and data:

```
from chromalab.observer import Spectra
import numpy as np

wavelengths = np.arange(400, 701, 1)
data = np.zeros_like(wavelengths)
data[190:] = 1

red = Spectra(wavelengths=wavelengths, data=data)
print(red.to_rgb())
```

To get the underlying numpy data, you can call `.array()`, or access `.data` and `.wavelengths` directly. 
Use the `interpolate_values(wavelengths)` method to interpolate your `Spectra` over any set of wavelengths.
If you want to pass in data outside 0 and 1 make sure to set `normalized` to `false`.

This library implements `Cone`, `Pigment`, and `Illuminant` as extensions of `Spectra`,
each equipped with some helpful methods. 

**Cone Fundamentals:**

Stockman and Sharpe (2000):

```
from chromalab.observer import Cone, Observer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


Cone.s_cone().plot()
Cone.m_cone().plot()
Cone.l_cone().plot()

plt.show()
```


From nomogram:

```
from chromalab.observer import Cone, Observer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

wavelengths = np.arange(400, 701, 1)  # set any wavelengths you want

for template in ["neitz", "govardovskii"]:
    Cone.m_cone(wavelengths, template=template).plot()

plt.show()
```

There is also the `cone` method where you can specify a peak directly, e.g. ``Cone.cone(530)``. You can also specify the
nomogram template, optical density, wavelengths, etc. 

Construct a cone fundamental from scratch:

```
from chromalab.observer import Cone, Observer, GovardovskiiNomogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

wavelengths = np.arange(400, 701, 1)  # set any wavelengths you want
GovardovskiiNomogram(wavelengths,530).with_preceptoral(od=0.35, lens=1, macular=0).plot(name="No macular pigment")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The Cone class has a variety of helpful instance methods. It is an extension of the Spectra class. 
Spectra are easy to plot, convert to RGB, XYZ, and combine in various ways.

**Observers:**

You can use the `Observer` class as a wrapper for a bunch of cones and some `Illuminant`. 
`Observer`s have helpful methods of being able convert any `Spectra` to their local coordinates.
You can initialize them by passing in a sequence of Cones, or by loading default observers:

```
from chromalab.observer import Observer
from chromalab.spectra import Illuminant


standard_trichromat = Observer.trichromat()
standard_tetrachromat = Observer.tetrachromat()

d65 = Illuminant.get("D65")
print(standard_trichromat.observe(d65))
print(standard_tetrachromat.observe(d65))
```

**Ink mixing:**

- `InkGamut` models the full gamut of a set of ink primaries
- you can either pass in ink primaries as a list of primaries (where each ink is a Spectra) or as a `Neugebauer` object
- If you pass in the former, it will generate a `Neugebauer` object using kubelka-munk interpolation
- If you've measured all the Neugebauer primaries, you can initialize your own `Neugebauer` object using a (key, Spectra) dictionary with keys corresponding to the binary codes of the primaries
- You should specify an illuminant as well, or it will default to equal-energy

Example usage:

```
from chromalab.spectra import Spectra, Illuminant
from chromalab.observer import Observer
from chromalab.inks import InkGamut, CellNeugebauer
import numpy as np

cmy = # ... load neugebauer primaries dict. For CMY, keys will be length 3 binary sequences

wavelengths1 = np.arange(390, 701, 1)
d65 = Illuminant.get("D65")
trichromat = Observer.trichromat()

cmy_neug = CellNeugebauer(cmy)
cmy_gamut = InkGamut(cmy, illuminant=d65)
point_cloud, percentages = cmy_gamut.get_point_cloud(trichromat)

```

There is also cellular neugebauer support, as well as a variety of methods for finding metamers in an `InkGamut`. 


**Plotting**

Plotting is the most helpful built-in function of `Spectra` objects and its descendents, `Cone`, `Pigment`, and `Illuminant`.

(hint: this feature works great in jupyter notebooks)

You can pass in no parameters and it will automatically color the plot according to its RGB code. 

```
from chromalab.observer import Spectra
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

wavelengths = np.arange(400, 701, 1)
data = np.zeros_like(wavelengths)
data[190:] = 1

red = Spectra(wavelengths=wavelengths, data=data)
red.plot()
plt.show()
```

Additionally, you can specify parameters like `name`, `color`, `alpha`, and `axis`. To use `name` remember to call
`plt.legend()`. Using a legend will automatically overwrite RGB coloring. 

```
from chromalab.spectra import Spectra
from chromalab.observer import Cone
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

wavelengths = np.arange(400, 701, 1)
data = np.zeros_like(wavelengths)
data[190:] = 1

red = Spectra(wavelengths=wavelengths, data=data)
cyan = 1 - red
red.plot(name="red")
cyan.plot(name="cyan")

Cone.m_cone().plot(name="m cone")

plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Illuminants**

Access default illuminants by using `Illuminant.get(name)`. A great variety of illuminants are supported,
accessed via the colour-science python library. For a complete list, check out the following:

**Development Installation**

A script has been written to install all of the requirements in a separate conda environment. It will create a conda environment titled "chromalab", and install python 3.11, with the requirements file, and install the editable package. 

Otherwise, to do so manually, install requirements first by making a conda enviornnment with python 3.11 `conda create -n chromalab python=3.11`, and then install packages with `pip install -r requirements`. Then, install the library while making it editable by with the `-e`. 
```
pip install -e /path/to/ChromaLab
```

From there, to edit with the jupyter notebook.
```
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```
